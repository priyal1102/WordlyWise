        EasyOCR helps users by recognizing letters, numbers, and other written characters.
        What is even more special about this is that it can convert images and scanned paper documents into
        electronic data. These documents can be searchable through digital means, making for seamless access.
        EasyOCR is the simplest and easiest way to implement Optical Character Recognition (OCR) with very few
        lines of code quickly and accurately.The information obtained through OCR is then more understandable.
        OCR is more accurate and takes less time than manual typing. It contributes to improved performance accuracy.
        </p><br>
        <p>Improved efficiency. One of the main benefits of OCR is its ability to automate the process of data
        entry and text recognition, saving time and reducing the risk of errors.Better access to information.
        Improved accuracy. Enhanced securityOCR systems are expensive to maintain. There is the need of lot
        of space required by the image produced. The quality of the image can be lose during this process
