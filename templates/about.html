        <h2>Handwriting Recognition with OCR</h2><br><br>

        <h4>What is OCR?</h4><br><br>
        Optical character recognition (OCR) technology that converts printed and physical documents into
        machine-readable texts has already spread across many industries.Handwriting recognition technology is an
        active area of artificial intelligence research. Its growing popularity drives its development. It has
        applications in areas such as enterprise, field services, and healthcare.New advances in machine learning
        are constantly improving the accuracy of handwriting recognition.

    <br><br><h4>Applications of OCR</h4><br><br>
        <ul>
                <li>The banking industry is using OCR to archive client-related paperwork to easily create
                    a client repository.</li>
                <li>For book scanning where turns raw images into digital text format.</li>
                <li>For digitization for various industries to cut down manual workload.</li>
                <li>Education - Handwriting recognition can be used in educational institutions to digitize
                    handwritten documents such as assignments, notes, and exams. This will help in reducing
                    the workload of teachers and allow them to focus more on teaching.</li>
